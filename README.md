# Hello there
Here's a bunch of things about me you might find interesting (or not)

- I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
- I'm a Solutions Architect
- I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
- My go-to language is JavaScript
- My go-to framework is Vue, but Svelte is definitely catching up
- I'm currently studying Functional Programming and Rust
- I suck at mobile layouts

My [blog](https://peruibeloko.github.io/) is pretty much dead, but I'll revive it at some point

I do music as well! If you like loud noises, consider checking some of [my stuff](https://soundcloud.com/dynmic) out :D
